# CTFs
CTFs and Vulnerability challenges are great.  Most of them also come with a training portion at the beginning of the challenges as well.  I have my Security+ students sign up for TryHackMe and work through the initial training, even if they have no interest in ethical hacking.  The training is network and Linux specific, which is important in both ethical hacking and Security+ studies.  

Throughout my own research and in preparing for Demos and Labs with students I have worked through CTFs and vulnerability challenges with OWASPs WebGoat, PicoCTF, TryHackMy and Over the Wire.  I am working on moving all of my solutions to this repository so they can be referenced by my students and anyone else who is interested in learning about them.
